# React Coding Test

In this test you will be asked to perform a few tasks in a simple React app to showcase what you can do. Before you start looking at the tasks and thinking about how to solve them, keep these important facts in mind:

* Simplicity and readability are at the core of good code. Keep your solutions as straight forward and readable as possible.
* We won't judge you based on how you did something, but based on **WHY** you chose to do it that way.
* You are free to modify the existing components and codebase at will (we will be asking why).
* Don't rush. We rather see 2 well implemented features than 4 bad ones.
